## AI
User sends prompt to the server and receives an answer after a short while.

## Booking appointment
User first selects the doctor then chooses available date and hour of an appointment.

Now user needs to fill form that validates input with his personal data.

At the final screen user confirms that submitted informations are valid and is prompted with information to confirm the appointment on link sent to the email address.

At the site shown after clicking link he can check patient informations once again and confirm appointment. Subsequent entry will ask if user wants to cancel the appointment. If the appointment is already cancelled or completed user can only check personal information (can't cancel already completed/cancelled visit).
